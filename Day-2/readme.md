## üõ† **Hands-On Demo**
We created a custom vision project and deployed it on Azure! Below is a quick guide on how to create your own model:

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Gather and label images relevant to your model.
2. **Create a Custom Vision Project**: Define project settings and classes.
3. **Upload and Tag Images**: Upload labeled images to train the model.
4. **Train and Test**: Train your model and test its accuracy.
5. **Deploy**: Deploy your model to integrate it with your app or system.

---

**Key Tip:** Regularly update your model with new data to ensure accuracy over time.
