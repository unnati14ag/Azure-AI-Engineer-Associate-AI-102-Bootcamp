## 🎯 Key Learnings from Day-1

### 1. **What is AI?**
   - AI refers to capabilities that enable software to exhibit human-like functions such as:
     - **Visual Perception** (e.g., object detection)
     - **Speech** (e.g., speech-to-text conversion)
     - **Decision Making** (e.g., recommendation systems)
     - **Text Analysis & Conversations** (e.g., sentiment analysis)
     - **Generating Text & Images** (e.g., using Generative AI like GPT models)

   > **AI -> Machine Learning (ML) -> Deep Learning -> Generative AI**

### 2. **AI Model Lifecycle**
   - Understanding the stages from data collection, model training, deployment, and continuous monitoring.
   
   *Explore more on AI lifecycle in my blog linked above!*

### 3. **Responsible AI and Ethics**
   - **Fairness**: Ensuring AI treats all groups fairly.
   - **Reliability & Safety**: Creating robust and safe AI systems.
   - **Privacy & Security**: Safeguarding data and user information.
   - **Inclusiveness**: Making AI accessible to all.
   - **Transparency & Accountability**: Ensuring clear, explainable models.
     
### 4. **Types of Azure AI Services**
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - **Knowledge Mining & Document Intelligence**
   - **Computer Vision**
   - **Decision Support**
   - **Generative AI** *(overview)*

### 5. **Provisioning Azure AI Services**
   - You can create AI resources in two ways:
     - **Single-Service Instance**: Create one service at a time (e.g., Speech service).
     - **Multi-Service Instance**: Bundle multiple AI services in a single resource.

   > Demo: We created a Speech service instance in seconds and played with its capabilities on the Azure Portal.

### 6. **Securing Azure AI Services**
   - **Authentication**: Protect AI services using Azure Key Vault and token-based authentication.
   - **Network Security**: Secure services with virtual networks, firewalls, and private endpoints.

   > Demo: Generated secure keys for Azure AI services and stored them in Azure Key Vault.

### 7. **Deploying AI in Containers**
   - Discussed scenarios where AI services can be deployed via Docker containers for private use.
   
   > Demo: Deployed an AI service in a container instance using Azure Container Instances.

### 8. **Monitoring Azure AI Services**
   - **Azure Monitor**: Track logs, monitor performance, and create action groups for alerts.

   > Demo: Showed how to view logs, metrics, and configure action groups in Azure Monitor.
